How much time did you spend on the assignment?
I spent some time trying to understand how anagrams work and I watched couple of youtube videos of how to implement it using hashtables.
I would say overall it took me two weeks but I think it was because I wanted to make sure the test run was running fine and that it would have less collisions.
Challenges you faced while implementing this assignment?
I had to find the best number for the size of the hashtable and the hash function. I ended up creating a method to find the size and 
I ended up running both the Java API and mine to make sure it was better or not.I had to try multiple different ways and the one I put seemed the most
reasonable and it gave the least amount of collisions.
What kind of help did you seek to overcome the challenges?
I had to watch some youtube videos on anagrams and how to use hashtables to implement them. That definitely helped me understand it a bit better before I went in to the project.
I also had to go back to the lectures and revisit some of the things to find the best way to get the least amount of collisions. 
What are some things you did really well on this assignment?
I think I found a really good way to beat the Java API and I liked that I used encapsulation well. 
If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
Create a table for the console. 
What do you feel is the purpose of this assignment?
To use our understanding from hashtables, Arrays, LinkedList, concept of Big O and the concept of testing to create a program 
that finds anagrams that takes less time and lists them as well as the count of the number of anagrams for each word. It seems easy but it keeps you thinking about it and find a better way to solve the problem.
